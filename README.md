# Flask Lung Disease Detection Web App

This is a Flask web application for lung disease detection using X-ray images. The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images of lungs and determine if the individual has a respiratory condition.

## Features
- Upload chest X-ray images for lung disease classification.
- The app predicts the likelihood of a disease such as Pneumonia or COVID-19.
- Displays results on the same page, along with relevant information.
- Stores images and metadata (age, gender) for record-keeping.
